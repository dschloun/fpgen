# 🧬 FPGen – Project Overview

Welcome to the **FPGen** project!  
This global README provides a quick overview of the project structure and guides new developers on where to find important parts of the codebase.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into **4 main folders**, each with its own responsibilities and README for detailed instructions:

### 1. `api`

- Contains the **API generator** and the related procedures.
- Responsible for generating backend and frontend API code from the API contract.
- Has its own README with detailed instructions on how to update and generate API code.

### 2. `backend`

- Contains the **backend application code**.
- Built using **Spring Boot**.
- The backend handles business logic, data persistence, and exposes the API.

### 3. `frontend`

- Contains the **frontend application code**.
- Built with **Angular**.
- The frontend consumes the backend API and provides the user interface.

### 4. `docker`

- Contains Docker configurations to launch different environments.
- Two main environments are provided:

    - **dev**: Starts a local database and Identity Access Management (IAM) services to allow development on your local machine.
    - **demo**: Runs the fully dockerized application for demonstration purposes.

- Each environment has detailed instructions in the folder README.

---

## 📚 Documentation

Each folder contains its own README file explaining how to set up, build, and run that part of the project:

- `api/README.md` – API contract and generator usage
- `backend/README.md` – Backend setup and launch instructions
- `frontend/README.md` – Frontend setup and launch instructions
- `docker/README.md` – Docker environment usage

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started:

1. Choose the folder you want to work on (`api`, `backend`, `frontend`, or `docker`).
2. Follow the instructions in its README file.
3. For development, you will typically start the Docker **dev** environment first to have the database and IAM services running.
4. Then launch the backend and frontend projects from your IDE or terminal.
